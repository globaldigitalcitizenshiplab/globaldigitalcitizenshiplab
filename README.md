### Hello.

Based in the Department of Sociology at York University, the Global Digital Citizenship Lab (GDCL) is a dynamic community of researchers at the cutting edge of social science research analyzing the digital world through a social justice lens. In particular, we are combining cultural analysis with digital and computational methods to study the online manifestations of controversies about some of the world's most pressing problems (COVID-19, gender-based online violence, climate change). We are interested in how laypersons and experts are acting as digital citizens involved in creating, interpreting, and disseminating evidence about these problems.
